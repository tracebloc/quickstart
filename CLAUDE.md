# CLAUDE.md

Repo-specific guidance for Claude Code sessions goes here, above the
managed org block: build/test commands, architecture notes, gotchas,
and this repo's default reviewer. Rollout: (internal ref).

## Checks

Two checkers, each with its own workflow and its own mutation harness.
Run both before pushing:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_templates.py                      # D9 template rules
python3 scripts/check_zoo_paths.py --zoo ../model-zoo   # zoo paths resolve
```

`check_zoo_paths.py` is the cross-repo one: every `model_zoo/...` path
this repo prints — the guide's table, its `MODEL_PATH` default, the
README — must exist in a `model-zoo` checkout. It needs one beside this
repo (`--clone` fetches it), and it **fails rather than skips** when it
cannot find one. The guide's default `MODEL_PATH` pointed at a file the
zoo had stopped shipping (#11) precisely because nothing connected the
two repos; its input lives in another repository, which is why the
workflow also runs nightly rather than only on this repo's commits.

Both take `--self-test` / a `_mutations.py` sibling that mutates a copy
of the tree and asserts every rule is SEEN to fail. Run it after editing
a rule: a checker passing says the tree is clean, only a mutation says
the checker can still fail.

### Branches & PRs

- Branch model, **for a repo on the release train**: `develop → staging → main`. Branch off `develop`; every PR targets `develop`. Never open PRs to `staging` or `main` — promotions are the train's job.
- **For a repo not on the train, do not infer the branch model from this file — read `repo-inventory.yml`.** `release_train:` says whether the model above applies at all, and the per-branch `exempt:` anchors record which branches actually exist. This bullet used to enumerate the exceptions by name and **drifted from the inventory on every one of them**: `docs` was called `main`-only while it had been on the train since 2026-08-04 (`release_train: true`, `develop: required`, staging present), and `rfcs` was called `main`-only while it had a `develop` taking merges (measured 2026-08-22, (internal ref) / .github#306). Restating the authority is the defect; pointing at it is the fix.
- **Trap, recorded in the inventory and caught by no check:** a `develop` created on a non-train repo and left **unprotected** is invisible to the guards — that is the `develop_unprotected_non_train` anchor, and the inventory notes "a `develop` created and left UNPROTECTED is not flagged … no check was going to surface it." So creating one to satisfy the first bullet **forks the repo silently**: PRs split between the new branch and the repo's existing convention, nothing promotes between them, and the two heads diverge until someone reconciles by hand. If a repo appears to lack a `develop`, that is a fact to verify in the inventory, not a gap to fill.
- Before starting any task: `git fetch` and branch from the current tip of `develop` — never build on a stale checkout. A branch that lives more than a day gets `develop` merged back in before review. We move fast; stale starts mean silent divergence and duplicated work.
- One self-contained change per PR. A few hundred changed lines reviews well; at 1000+ split it. Refactors ship in separate PRs from behavior changes.
- Branches are short-lived (aim to merge within a day or two), single-author, and based on `develop` — no stacked PRs on top of other open PRs.
- Your branches are yours to clean up. Merged ones now delete themselves server-side, so this is about the rest: run `git reap` (from `tracebloc/org-config/scripts/git-reap`) in your checkouts now and then. It is dry-run by default and only proposes a branch when it can prove the work landed. Nobody else can do this for you — you are the only one who knows whether an *unmerged* branch of yours still matters, and `git branch --merged` will not tell you, because we squash-merge and a squashed branch is not an ancestor of `develop`.
- **"Yours" is the branch you opened the PR for, never the branch whose last commit is yours.** Pushing a review fixup onto someone else's branch makes you its tip-commit author and changes nothing about whose work it is — so a "my branches" list built from `%(authorname)`, or from the tip author in any form, aims your cleanup at other people's work. Measured: two of Shujaat's `client` branches showed up on such a list and were one confirmation step away from `--delete` ((internal ref)). If you are building any list that reasons about ownership, call `tracebloc/org-config/scripts/branch_owner.py` rather than re-deriving it; a branch it cannot attribute comes back as `unattributable`, which is the answer to act on, not to fill in.
- Names and commits: `feat/ fix/ docs/ sec/ ci/ chore/` + issue number + short slug (`fix/1234-ingest-timeout`); commit subjects `type(scope): summary`, referencing the ticket (`(internal ref)`). **`(scope)` is the component — `mint-scope`, `kanban` — never the ticket number.** A number in a PR title (`sec(2157): …`) is read by `closing-ref` as a reference the body must make good, in one of two forms: `Closes <owner>/<repo>#N` when this PR really finishes the ticket, or `Part of <owner>/<repo>#N` when it does not. Both satisfy the check; only `Closes` closes the ticket and moves its card, so never write it for partial work — and a bare `Closes #N` resolves against the repo you are in, which for a `(internal ref)` ticket links the wrong issue. Keeping the number in the title is right either way: naming the parent is traceability, not a promise to close it ((internal ref)).
- When you open a PR: assign yourself and request exactly one reviewer immediately — a PR without a reviewer stalls by construction. You pick the reviewer: whoever knows the code best. There is no per-repo default, and no automation assigns one — branch protection just refuses to merge without a review.
- When you are the reviewer: first response within one business day.

### Quality bar

- Before every push: run the linter and the tests that cover your change. Never push a branch you believe is red — CI is the backstop, not the first run.
- Read the full diff before opening the PR. You own every line you ship, whoever — or whatever — wrote it.
- AI sessions end with evidence, not assertion: run the relevant check (tests, build, lint) and show the output. A change that could not be verified does not ship.
- Fix the class, not the instance. The bug you just fixed is a member of a class; check the rest of the class before you push. Two shapes, and aiming at only the first catches half of them: **other call sites** — grep the symbol or pattern you changed — and **other inputs to the same guard** — what else reaches this branch? If the class can't be cheaply enumerated, say so in the PR rather than leaving it implied that you covered it.
- After opening or pushing to a PR, stay on it: poll CI and Bugbot on the current head and triage every finding the same day — fix it, or reply on the thread saying why not. No silent dismissals. Unresolved threads block the merge and stall the release train's settle stage; cheap now beats expensive later.
- A finding that recurs across PRs becomes a rule: add it to `.cursor/BUGBOT.md`, and if it is grep-expressible, to code-quality's house-rules — then stop re-arguing it in comments.
- Style and naming rules live in tooling (black/ruff, eslint/prettier, house-rules), never in prose. If a rule matters, encode it; do not restate linter rules in CLAUDE.md files.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, or customer data — not in code, config, tests, issues, or commit messages. gitleaks catches secrets in **code**. Nothing scans PR titles, descriptions or commit messages: the public PII gate that did was retired on 2026-08-06 ((internal ref)), so keeping customer names out of PR prose on public repos is on you, not on a check.

### Engineer kanban

- Every ticket on the board carries a `Status` — no card sits at "No Status". New tickets start in `Backlog`. **Bugs are the exception:** label them `work-type:bug` (the Bug template does it) and automation moves the card straight into `Ready` — defects don't wait for refinement. This holds in every repo, and the exception that used to be written here is gone rather than kept accurate by hand: the labels exist fleet-wide, and `triage-labels.yml` asserts daily that every label the templates apply and the caller fires on exists in every repo declaring that caller. A hand-written exception list drifts on every entry — it named two repos while the inventory said three — so the fix was to empty it ((internal ref)).
- Picking up work: the team coordinates. `Ready` is the refined queue — bugs excepted, per the line above — and the first choice when it's stocked; pulling from `Backlog` is normal when refinement hasn't caught up — say what you're taking.
- Merging to `develop` moves the card to `On dev` automatically; there is no dev-side review.
- Functional review happens once, on staging: when it passes, comment `/fr-pass` on the PR or drag the card to `Ready for prod`. Self-signoff is allowed.
- `fr-gate` is a required check on promotions. If it blocks, the board or the work isn't ready — fix that. `skip-fr-gate` is audited, for emergencies only.

### Releases & publishing

- The release train is the only path to `staging`, `main`, and every package registry. Never hand-cut a `v*` tag or publish an artifact — every legal publish path is inventoried in release-train's `PUBLISH-PATHS.md`. _(The `hand-bump a version file` clause was removed on 2026-09-08: it contradicted a REQUIRED check, and the meta-rule above says an enforced rule leaves this file. `version-bump-gate / version-check` fails a PR that touches a published path while the version file still reads an already-released version — "Bump package.json in this PR. The release train reads that file and cuts the tag from it — it never bumps for you." So the bump a feature PR ships is the train's INPUT, not a bypass of it. Read literally, the old clause forbade what the gate demands: it blocked two component PRs on design-system-v2 until someone put the two side by side, and a reviewer there opened and then retracted a change-request over the same collision.)_
- Findings on a promotion PR are fixed on the source branch (`develop`/`staging`), then the train re-prepares. Never push fixes onto a promotion PR — every push re-rolls its review.

### Filing issues

- Internal work — planning, epics, security findings, infrastructure, anything mentioning a customer — is filed in `backend` (the private catch-all), never in a public repo. When in doubt: `backend`.
- Public repos (`cli`, `client`, `docs`, `data-ingestors`, `model-zoo`, `start-training`, `.github`) only get issues a stranger could act on: about the public artifact itself, with no customer names, internal URLs, or internal paths.

### AI-assisted sessions (Claude Code, etc.)

- An AI session may open PRs and push its own branches. It never: merges a PR, closes another person's PR, deletes another person's branch, or force-pushes — each of those needs an explicit instruction from the human running it.
- If your change makes a statement in any CLAUDE.md, BUGBOT.md, or runbook false, update that file in the same PR.
