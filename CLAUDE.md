# CLAUDE.md

Repo-specific guidance for Claude Code sessions goes here, above the
managed org block: build/test commands, architecture notes, gotchas,
and this repo's default reviewer. Rollout: (internal ref).

## Checks

Two checkers, each with its own workflow and its own mutation harness.
Run both before pushing:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_templates.py                      # D9 template rules
python3 scripts/check_zoo_paths.py --zoo ../model-zoo   # zoo paths resolve
```

`check_zoo_paths.py` is the cross-repo one: every `model_zoo/...` path
this repo prints — the guide's table, its `MODEL_PATH` default, the
README — must exist in a `model-zoo` checkout. It needs one beside this
repo (`--clone` fetches it), and it **fails rather than skips** when it
cannot find one. The guide's default `MODEL_PATH` pointed at a file the
zoo had stopped shipping (#11) precisely because nothing connected the
two repos; its input lives in another repository, which is why the
workflow also runs nightly rather than only on this repo's commits.

Both take `--self-test` / a `_mutations.py` sibling that mutates a copy
of the tree and asserts every rule is SEEN to fail. Run it after editing
a rule: a checker passing says the tree is clean, only a mutation says
the checker can still fail.

## tracebloc engineering standards (org-wide)

<!-- Canonical source: the private source repo/org-standards.md.
     Synced into every repo's CLAUDE.md between org-standards markers — never
     edit it inside a consuming repo; open a PR against the private source repo.
     Meta-rule: the moment a rule below becomes mechanically enforced (a lint
     rule, a house-rules grep, a required check), delete the sentence here and
     let the check carry it. Prose is only for what tooling can't judge. -->

### Where the rules and the automation live

- Org-wide automation — the reusable workflows every repo calls, `repo-inventory.yml`, this file, the review and ship dispatchers — lives in `the private source repo`; per-repo callers pin `@main`. `tracebloc/.github` is the org's public profile (README + issue templates) and carries no workflows; nothing new goes there.
- **Mirrors take no work.** A `visibility: public` row carrying `mirror_of:` in `repo-inventory.yml` is a publish target of the private source that row names — releases, a Helm index, a README — and nothing else. Never open a PR, push a branch, or file an issue about internal work on a mirror; do it in the source. Publishing is the source's `mirror-publish` workflow through its publish guard and `.publish-forbidden` list, and the weekly anonymous exposure audit checks the mirror's tree against that same list. Which repos are mirrors today is the inventory's answer, not this file's.

### Branches & PRs

- Branch model, **for a repo on the release train**: `develop → staging → main`. Branch off `develop`; every PR targets `develop`. Never open PRs to `staging` or `main` — promotions are the train's job.
- **For a repo not on the train, do not infer the branch model from this file — read `repo-inventory.yml`.** `release_train:` says whether the model above applies at all, and the per-branch `exempt:` anchors record which branches actually exist. This bullet used to enumerate the exceptions by name and **drifted from the inventory on every one of them**: `(internal ref)` was called `main`-only while it had been on the train since 2026-08-04 (`release_train: true`, `develop: required`, staging present), and `(internal ref)` was called `main`-only while it had a `develop` taking merges (measured 2026-08-22, (internal ref) / (internal ref)). Restating the authority is the defect; pointing at it is the fix.
- **Trap, recorded in the inventory and caught by no check:** a `develop` created on a non-train repo and left **unprotected** is invisible to the guards — that is the `develop_unprotected_non_train` anchor, and the inventory notes "a `develop` created and left UNPROTECTED is not flagged … no check was going to surface it." So creating one to satisfy the first bullet **forks the repo silently**: PRs split between the new branch and the repo's existing convention, nothing promotes between them, and the two heads diverge until someone reconciles by hand. If a repo appears to lack a `develop`, that is a fact to verify in the inventory, not a gap to fill.
- Before starting any task: `git fetch` and branch from the current tip of `develop` — never build on a stale checkout. A branch that lives more than a day gets `develop` merged back in before review. We move fast; stale starts mean silent divergence and duplicated work.
- One self-contained change per PR. A few hundred changed lines reviews well; at 1000+ split it. Refactors ship in separate PRs from behavior changes.
- Branches are short-lived (aim to merge within a day or two), single-author, and based on `develop` — no stacked PRs on top of other open PRs.
- Your branches are yours to clean up. Merged ones now delete themselves server-side, so this is about the rest: run `git reap` (from `the private source repo/scripts/git-reap`) in your checkouts now and then. It is dry-run by default and only proposes a branch when it can prove the work landed. Nobody else can do this for you — you are the only one who knows whether an *unmerged* branch of yours still matters, and `git branch --merged` will not tell you, because we squash-merge and a squashed branch is not an ancestor of `develop`.
- **"Yours" is the branch you opened the PR for, never the branch whose last commit is yours.** Pushing a review fixup onto someone else's branch makes you its tip-commit author and changes nothing about whose work it is — so a "my branches" list built from `%(authorname)`, or from the tip author in any form, aims your cleanup at other people's work. Measured: two of Shujaat's `client` branches showed up on such a list and were one confirmation step away from `--delete` ((internal ref)). If you are building any list that reasons about ownership, call `the private source repo/scripts/branch_owner.py` rather than re-deriving it; a branch it cannot attribute comes back as `unattributable`, which is the answer to act on, not to fill in.
- Names and commits: `feat/ fix/ docs/ sec/ ci/ chore/` + issue number + short slug (`fix/1234-ingest-timeout`); commit subjects `type(scope): summary`, referencing the ticket (`(internal ref)`). **`(scope)` is the component — `mint-scope`, `kanban` — never the ticket number.** A number in a PR title (`sec(2157): …`) is read by `closing-ref` as a reference the body must make good, in one of two forms: `Closes <owner>/<repo>#N` when this PR really finishes the ticket, or `Part of <owner>/<repo>#N` when it does not. Both satisfy the check; only `Closes` closes the ticket and moves its card, so never write it for partial work — and a bare `Closes #N` resolves against the repo you are in, which for a `(internal ref)` ticket links the wrong issue. Keeping the number in the title is right either way: naming the parent is traceability, not a promise to close it ((internal ref)).
- When you open a PR: assign yourself. The review account `tracebloc-review` is the default — and the only required — reviewer: request it (on a repo whose `repo-inventory.yml` row **requires or carries a `copy` of** `desk-dispatch.yml` the review dispatcher requests it itself on every `opened` / `ready_for_review`, whoever opened the PR — that is the route that covers human-opened PRs; the ship tooling does on every PR it opens; CODEOWNERS does where the repo carries the rule). Where that dispatcher runs, its review is produced once the head's checks are terminal and green, and its approval satisfies branch protection's required review. Add a human reviewer only when you want one by name; there is no per-repo human default, and a PR with neither request, on a repo the review dispatcher does not cover, stalls by construction.
- When a human is asked to review by name: first response within one business day. Where the review dispatcher runs — every repo whose `repo-inventory.yml` row **requires or carries a `copy` of** `desk-dispatch.yml`, which is the list, and which today is every repo this file reaches — it answers every green head within its next sweep; where it does not, the human you named is the whole of the review. Read the cell, not the word `required`: a `copy` row (`model-zoo`, `quickstart` — both public, so they cannot `uses:` a private reusable and carry the content-asserted render under `.github/workflows/` instead) runs the same dispatcher. The ship bullet below keys on `requires` alone because there is no `copy` of `ship-dispatch.yml` anywhere: `.github/self-contained/` holds eleven renders and that is not one of them.
- **Lock labels are a session at work.** `claude-desk:reviewing` means the review account is reading that head; `claude-ship:driving` (with `claude-ship:driving-<N>`) means an author-side session is repairing it. Never push to, re-request review on, or merge a PR carrying one — wait for the label to clear or for the session's comment. A lock past its TTL is stolen by the sweep, not by hand; a lock the sweep reports as `LOCK AGE UNREADABLE` is the one a human takes off — the sweep fires nothing on an unreadable age, exactly as it fires nothing on a held one, so that state clears only by hand.

### Quality bar

- Before every push: run the linter and the tests that cover your change. Never push a branch you believe is red — CI is the backstop, not the first run.
- Read the full diff before opening the PR. You own every line you ship, whoever — or whatever — wrote it.
- AI sessions end with evidence, not assertion: run the relevant check (tests, build, lint) and show the output. A change that could not be verified does not ship.
- Fix the class, not the instance. The bug you just fixed is a member of a class; check the rest of the class before you push. Two shapes, and aiming at only the first catches half of them: **other call sites** — grep the symbol or pattern you changed — and **other inputs to the same guard** — what else reaches this branch? If the class can't be cheaply enumerated, say so in the PR rather than leaving it implied that you covered it.
- After opening a PR the ship dispatcher takes it **in every repo whose `repo-inventory.yml` row requires `ship-dispatch.yml`** — not all of them, and that row is the list rather than anything enumerated here: on every review or check event a `ship` session runs as you — fixes Bugbot, CI and review findings, replies on the threads, resolves them, and merges when the bar holds (checks green, approved, Bugbot clean, no conflict). **Where it runs**, do not poll CI or Bugbot yourself (`gh pr checks --watch`, `gh run watch`, a loop of either): the account's GitHub API budget is one bucket shared by every session, routine and CI job, and polling has emptied it. **Where it does not, triaging your own PR is still yours** — and on a `visibility: public` row that is not a gap waiting to be filled: a public repo cannot `uses:` a reusable workflow that lives in a private repo, so no caller is coming there until a self-contained variant exists. What comes back to you is `claude-ship:handback` — the session hit its change-request cap; read its summary comment and decide. No silent dismissals: every finding is fixed or answered on its thread, because unresolved threads block the merge and stall the release train's settle stage.
- A finding that recurs across PRs becomes a rule: add it to `.cursor/BUGBOT.md`, and if it is grep-expressible, to code-quality's house-rules — then stop re-arguing it in comments.
- Style and naming rules live in tooling (black/ruff, eslint/prettier, house-rules), never in prose. If a rule matters, encode it; do not restate linter rules in CLAUDE.md files.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, or customer data — not in code, config, tests, issues, or commit messages. gitleaks catches secrets in **code**. Nothing scans PR titles, descriptions or commit messages: the public PII gate that did was retired on 2026-08-06 ((internal ref)), so keeping customer names out of PR prose on public repos is on you, not on a check. The same goes, on every `visibility: public` row, for internal references in PR titles, bodies and commit messages — ticket numbers into private repos, RFC ids, private repo names: the exposure audit scans the files this org delivers there, not the prose you type.

### Engineer kanban

- Every ticket on the board carries a `Status` — no card sits at "No Status". New tickets start in `Backlog`. **Bugs are the exception:** label them `work-type:bug` (the Bug template does it) and automation moves the card straight into `Ready` — defects don't wait for refinement. This holds in every repo, and the exception that used to be written here is gone rather than kept accurate by hand: the labels exist fleet-wide, and `triage-labels.yml` asserts daily that every label the templates apply and the caller fires on exists in every repo declaring that caller. A hand-written exception list drifts on every entry — it named two repos while the inventory said three — so the fix was to empty it ((internal ref)).
- Picking up work: the team coordinates. `Ready` is the refined queue — bugs excepted, per the line above — and the first choice when it's stocked; pulling from `Backlog` is normal when refinement hasn't caught up — say what you're taking.
- Merging to `develop` moves the card to `On dev` automatically; there is no dev-side review.
- Functional review happens once, on staging: when it passes, comment `/fr-pass` on the PR or drag the card to `Ready for prod`. Self-signoff is allowed.
- `fr-gate` is a required check on promotions. If it blocks, the board or the work isn't ready — fix that. `skip-fr-gate` is audited, for emergencies only.

### Releases & publishing

- The release train is the only path to `staging`, `main`, and every package registry. Never hand-cut a `v*` tag or publish an artifact — every legal publish path is inventoried in (internal ref)'s `PUBLISH-PATHS.md`. _(The `hand-bump a version file` clause was removed on 2026-09-08: it contradicted a REQUIRED check, and the meta-rule above says an enforced rule leaves this file. `version-bump-gate / version-check` fails a PR that touches a published path while the version file still reads an already-released version — "Bump package.json in this PR. The release train reads that file and cuts the tag from it — it never bumps for you." So the bump a feature PR ships is the train's INPUT, not a bypass of it. Read literally, the old clause forbade what the gate demands: it blocked two component PRs on (internal ref) until someone put the two side by side, and a reviewer there opened and then retracted a change-request over the same collision.)_
- Findings on a promotion PR are fixed on the source branch (`develop`/`staging`), then the train re-prepares. Never push fixes onto a promotion PR — every push re-rolls its review.

### Filing issues

- Internal work — planning, epics, security findings, infrastructure, anything mentioning a customer — is filed in `(internal ref)` (the private catch-all), never in a public repo. When in doubt: `(internal ref)`.
- Public repos -- every `visibility: public` row in `the private source repo/repo-inventory.yml` -- only get issues a stranger could act on: about the public artifact itself, with no customer names, internal URLs, or internal paths. This bullet used to enumerate them by name and drifted. Restating the authority is the defect; the inventory is the list.

### AI-assisted sessions (Claude Code, etc.)

- An interactive AI session may open PRs and push its own branches. It never: merges a PR, closes another person's PR, deletes another person's branch, or force-pushes — each of those needs an explicit instruction from the human running it. The one exception is the ship dispatcher's `ship --pr` session, which merges the PR it was fired on when — and only when — the bar above holds; invoking that routine is the standing instruction.
- If your change makes a statement in any CLAUDE.md, BUGBOT.md, or runbook false, update that file in the same PR.
